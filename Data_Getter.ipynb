God [Applause] bless [Music] I [Music] [Applause] wow hello [Applause] everybody well thank you very much I want to tell you that was a hell of a trip I just took that was really tough we had a great time and one of your very nice districts you know where I'm talking about and I was told between the weather and we decided brilliantly to rent a small plane because it could save you about 15 minutes if you drove and we did we rented a small we land with the big one we got into a small one cuz the runways were a little small for the other one and to save 15 minutes it took us a couple of hours because the small plane didn't work somebody in Iowa had a plane that was for rent and we said let's take that play we'll save a couple of minutes but you know my people were great they said look the people of Clinton won't mind sir you can cancel and it'll be fine they said sir honestly you could cancel they won't mind at all and I said there's no way I'm canceling Clinton there's no way man do we get an A for effort though that was that was quite a trip that was quite a trip but there was no way I would never even think about it especially when I saw the lines that's all over the Internet the lines of people going back so far so I want to thank you I wouldn't have the courage to do it if you want to know the truth we have courage to do a lot of things but we'll start by just saying hello Iowa you're going to win this election for us so big happy New Year happy New Year because nine days from now the people of this state are going to cast the most important vote of your entire lives and I used to say that 2016 I'd say that and I meant it but this is more important because they're destroying your nation they are destroying your nation like nobody's ever seen before what they've done is so sad in every way the borders the military you look at all this inflation killing you Afghanistan you know the press the fake news wants to forget about Afghanistan the incompetence which led to other things like Putin going into Ukraine he went into Ukraine he saw the incompetence of Afghanistan he says let's give it a shot why not they wouldn't have done it with me they wouldn't have attacked Israel with me they wouldn't have attacked there was no way Iran was broke they were broke when I was president and they became very rich in the last three years because of Biden Biden most corrupt president we've ever had the worst president we've ever had worst president we've ever had you know and it's nice because he's an older guy but this is I think it's really nice Jimmy Carter is happy right now because his administration is brilliant it's brilliant people say he had a brilliant Administration compared to Joe Biden crooked Joe Biden I would say Jimmy Carter was a brilliant president all of a sudden first time and I hope he likes hearing that because I mean it by delivering a massive victory in Iowa you will send a thundering message straight to Crooked Joe Biden and the fake news look at all those cameras back there that's a lot to the fake news media and all of the evil and Sinister people trying to destroy this nation with you vote for our campaign on Monday January 15th it's finally here we're here we waited and waited you will declare that we're going to take back our country we're going to defeat Joe Biden and we're going to make America great again and it all starts here in Iowa 700 p.m. Martin Luther King day so don't stay home just please you know the polls are showing we're going to win by a lot and uh worst thing you can do oh let let's just stay home Alice let's watch let's watch it on television we don't want to do that you got to get out because the more we win by we're shooting for November because we got to send a message we got to send a message we can't be beaten because if we are beaten we're not going to have a country left anymore they're destroying this country nobody's ever seen anything like it grossly incompetent and also totally corrupt and what they're doing with elections with the interference is incredible it's Warfare and really is they call it lawfare I call it Warfare I think it really is Warfare if you're a firsttime caucus goer you can learn how to caucus and find your caucus location which is often different than where you normally vote it's at I A.D donaldjtrump.com okay and I'm going to be learning how to caucus too because I'm going to be up here with you I'll be here we're not taking any chances and they're going to teach me all about caucusing because I didn't do this one before and uh we've had some great Thrills here great victories here we won two elections do you know that if you win Florida Ohio and Iowa in history there's never been a president that lost the election except for me you know was a rigged election now if you win Florida think of it Florida Ohio and Iowa there's never been a president and we won in a landslide each one of them we won you in a landslide we won them all in a landslide uh I could give you about 30 other statistics like that too but you know what we're going to do we're going to win this one and it's going to be the biggest single political event in the history of our country that's all we're going to turn it around and we're going to turn it around fast right so get out and vote don't listen to the polls in fact pretend instead of being 40 points up or some crazy number you know nationally we're 66% up it came out 66% I don't mean we're at 66 I mean so you guys are a little far behind for people I got $28 billion do for the farmers you know because you're only about 40 points up but don't believe that either pretend you're one point down okay you're one point down you have to get out and you have to vote vote vote you got to do it by big big margins we're thrilled to be joined today by state representatives fantastic people Bobby Kaufman where's Bobby Bobby did he do a good job he was telling you about caucusing he was telling you about caucusing thank you Bobby great guy Luanna stoltenberg who's fantastic LNA thank you great great job thank you for being here great endorsements we have endorsements for all the from all these people and mark czos thank you very much thank you Mark thank you Mark great appreciate it tremendous uh energy tremendous just tremendous people we have tremendous endorsements in the state all over the country they're pouring in it's amazing how they pour in when you are winning by 50 or 60 points all of a sudden sir I'd like very much to endorse you I think you're fabulous it's amazing how that happens isn't it the stakes of this election could not be higher under crooked Joe Biden our borders have been erased they've been to we don't have borders anymore it's not even believable because you can't have a country Without Borders millions of illegal aliens are invading from all over the world our middle class is being crushed by Joe Biden's crippling inflation the worst maybe the worst we've ever had they say in 52 years I guess that's okay but probably the worst violent criminals are running wild in Democrat run cities while law enforcement has been weaponized against Christians conservatives and people of faith and you know Catholics I don't know if there's too many Catholics in this room are there you know they are I don't know what it is with the Catholics but they're really going after Catholics have you seen that and I helped the Catholics I gave them billions of dollars in New York City to help with the schools because they were closing during the Gina virus period and they were people called Co every says what is co it's a China virus it came from China right we have war in Europe War in the Middle East China is threatening Taiwan Iran is inches away from a nuclear bomb you know they have 37 days there I just heard now I say give me updates on that 37 Days Iran is going to have a nuclear weapon if the election weren't r rigged you would have had this thing done within one week of the election and they wouldn't have a nuclear weapon and they would have been very happy but they were desperate to make a deal now they don't have to make a deal they're very rich Biden gave them $250 billion when he took off all the sanctions that's what they have now they're now or well they were broke and in three years they've made by selling oil to countries that weren't allowed to buy it because I said to China if you buy oil you can't do business in the US they said like we say I don't I think we're going to buy oil and I said we're going to put 100% tariffs on if you do that too so it's a terrible thing you know it's a terrible thing but uh what they've done and and uh in another 30 days it's going to be a lot tougher to negotiate I can tell you that we would have gotten everything it's going to be a much different deal and I just it's just impossible to believe the incompetence of the people that have destroyed our country but we're going to get it back and it's going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before remember that remember right our military has gone woke and we are teetering on the brink of World War I this is the closest we've ever come to World War II I don't know if you see what's going on out there we have a president who's incompetent he can't put two sentences together he can't find his way off the stage he can't find it never he's looking around he's always looking for stairs has anyone [Applause] see you know to show you how dishonest the fake news is these guys they show that and they say Trump could not find his way off the stage true and when I mimic him or you know talk like he does which is I don't want to do it because every time I do they say Donald Trump had a hard time but that's how dishonest they are even when Sean Hannity the other night I did a a town hall he's a good guy too he is a good guy but he said okay because he want this you're not going to be a dictator is that I said no no Sean I'm going to be a dictator I said that right you guys know it better than I do I'm going to be a dictator for one day and we're going to build the wall we're going to complete the wall cuz we built it but we're going to clean up that hole we're going to stop and we're going to finish he should have he could have finished it in two weeks you know we built over 500 miles of wall I could have finished it in two weeks that's when I realized was going but I said Sean I'm going to be a dictator but one day we're going to do the wall and we're going to become energy independent we're going to drill baby drill drill baby drill and then I said right cuz he's right there he's on the ball this guy well he's a caucus Captain I want one of those hats too I like that hat more than that is a great hat I'm going to be look I'm doing caucus I don't know if I'm a captain I think that no I think I'll just be one of the regular folks back there the captains are big shots with those hats those hats are beautiful white and gold but I also said to him right and then I'm not going to be a dictator one day I said one day we're going to stop the invasion of our country number one and we're going to become energy independent we're going to drill baby drill and then I said and then I'm not going to be a dictator any longer so the fake news said I'm going to be a dictator in other words that's where they cut it I said I'm going to be a dictator for one day right they said I'm going to be a dictator they cut the one day out they cut everything out and the headline was Donald Trump wants to be a dictator we've known it for years but he's admitted it and these are like networks this isn't even the you know the fake CNN and the fake Ms DNC because it is DNC democ Ms Democrat National Committee right you know they like Democratic but it sounds worse when you say Democrat Democratic sounds too nice they ought to change the name if they want to be called that but these are the these are the networks and the other day was great because you know branding is a great thing branding is very important in life I tell you you want to Brand so I I really branded Ronda sanctimonious look I got him elected and then he forgot about it you know totally forgot I got him elected he was down so low he had no chance he came to my office he said please please tears coming down his I I mean this guy was desperate he had somebody that was up 35 points the secretary of agriculture Adam putam I didn't know the gentleman I feel sorry for him now I wish I would have endorsed him he was at 42 or something Ron was down at around three he was very low and I said you know what okay CU on the impeachment hoax number one and two uh he was one of about 150 congressmen who went on television would fight for me a little bit so I didn't know the other guy so he said all right I did so I pressed that little sacred button I said being and he went up like the the race was over and the other guy Adam he was up in Tallahassee they were measuring the rooms for carpet you know the race was over it was like about a 30 point spread or some massive spread and he won and then I helped him get by the Democrat opponent who they all said you know good-look guy they said he was going to be a president someday he had a big future turned out to be a crack addict but remember that guy he was a beauty but he was way ahead of Ron and we worked and I said we'll do a couple of rallies we did two or three rallies we had massive crowds they won and then four years later they said will you run and he said I have no comment when he said I have I said he's going to run this guy's going to run I got him elect and I got him you know some people I help some people don't need help I think they all need help actually because it's tough out there but some people don't need much he was dead it was over he was going to go out he was going to either work at a pizza chain or he was going to work in a law office and he was dead he was gone I got him elected and then they said are you going to run he said I have no comment on that I said this guy's going to run and my people in the back they said sir don't hit him so hard he's a republican sir I said I don't care if he's a republic who the hell cares if he's a Republican and by the way we're people of common sense you know we're conservative I guess at all right but what we really are is because this is what being conservative I think is they're people of Common Sense we want borders we want Fair elections we want low interest rates we want strong military we want low taxes we gave you the biggest tax decrease ever no what people of Common Sense we want voter ID right can you imagine they don't want voter ID why does somebody not want voter ID because they want to cheat I'm the only candidate in this race who is up to the task of saving America from every single Biden desire as to starting day one I know every one of them I know what they've done we're going to knock them out very quickly and you won't have to buy an electric car and you'll be able to cook on your gas stove from day one and if you want to buy it you can but you're going to have a lot of choices you're going to have a lot of choices all right you're going to have you know we have something called Liquid Gold under off it right that equates to gasoline for a car but it's oil and gas we have more than any other country we will making a fortune we were energy independent energy was at the lowest point for decades and decades we were selling it we were going to sell to Europe we were going to sell to Asia we're going to make so much money we're going to reduce our debt but then we had this terrible situation with the election which was uh we can never let that happen again we can't let it happen again if it happens again this country is finished this country is finished since 2016 you and I have been in this battle side by side I recognize a lot of the people in this we've been doing this for a while that's why I showed up tonight I know you you're not going to take that very nice ladies and after standing in line for 6 hours and being in here for three hours although you're listening to good music right and then I come and say uh I'm not going to show up tonight Clinton I think that's the end of that you'd probably vote for uh Ronda santimon Nikki Haley Vic would you votee for Vic you wouldn't vote for sloppy Chris Christie I don't think that much you wouldn't do but take it on the entire corrupt system in Washington like no one's ever done before we've done that together together we stood up and we really did we stood up to the failed establishment the corrupt media they're the most corrupt people on Earth they are as bad as anybody just like I told you the story walking into a wall where they show you walking into a worldall they say Trump just walked in couldn't find his way off the stage by the way you know these stages this one only has two because you people are cheap but usually you have no usually you have three or four some of them have like five stairs you have so many stairs it's like impossible not to hit one and he can never find it this is not the man we want negotiating nuclear with Russia or China do we agree but we stood up and we stood up to the Deep state that globalists the warmongers people that want to go into war with every country that even countries you've never even heard of they don't even want us over there the Wall Street special interest the open borders Fanatics the green new scam people you know the green new scam we're spending trillions of dollars on the green news scam and the radical left we uh we achieve more than any Administration in the history of our country we've done things that nobody believed possible I mean biggest tax cut in history biggest regulation Cuts in history greatest job numbers in history I mean we have you know their job numbers are fake because a lot of people aren't looking for jobs because they handed them so much money and those people won't be working for a long time they're not real job numbers and our country is in trouble I actually think that if for any reason something happens and we don't win I think we're going to go into a depression the reason the stock market's good is because they you know every poll has us winning by a lot and every time there's a good poll watch it the stock market goes up and up and up and up and if something happened where it gets stolen because it's the only way they're going to do it they they're they're professional thieves they're the greatest if they devoted that genius to fixing our country we would have the most successful country ever ever but they're not they want to destroy the country with your vote these caucuses we going to finish the job bigger and better and stronger than ever before our country will be believe it or not it's hard to believe now because you see those scenes at the border with millions of people trying to get in and don't forget many of those people are from prisons many of those people are from mental institutions insane asylums many of them are terrorists many of them are terrorists we have people coming into our country and uh we're going to get them out we're going to have to because no country can sustain this you can't sustain This Together We have fought long and hard to rescue the Republican party from the likes of Mitt Romney how bad is Mitt Romney is he the worst you know he likes to pretend he's like legit remember he did the thing on Twitter by the way truth is the best there nothing like truth but in those days with his Twitter where he had the fake nameer Deo very good Pierre dcto who the hell said that that's very good I was just going to say it he's a serious this guy is serious politics right that's why we kept the Iowa in that's why we kept you know you're only first you're first in the nation you're first because of me not because of anyone else you know they like to take credit they said sir sir could you help us I said yeah I'll do it I'm going to keep it because I made that pledge to you seven years ago I said if we win you're going to be first in the nation they wanted to move you to the back of the pack and in fact the Democrats basically have done that you know they're not going to be here with us which is fine as far as I'm concerned I think I think it was I think it was a stupid decision because to me Iowa it means Farmers it means just beautiful everything I drove here even in this horrible rain and snow well it's pretty beautiful actually the snow came down the rain I saw everything in a period of 20 minutes from I saw every form of weather in the period of about 25 minutes cuz we were going slightly fast thank you very much Secret Service we're going like those red lights they didn't mean a thing it was just but I saw every form of weather you can see but uh we're going to do something we're going to do something really really great we're going to this will be when we win you know people want to say I always like to say if because I don't want to jinx it you understand does anyone understand they say sir not if it's what I've seen I've seen what they can do they can work magic where you're win winning in Pennsylvania by like close to a million votes and all of a sudden a miracle happens at 3 302 in the morning they found they found another million ballots so we've got very good people I'll tell you we have a great group of people and we had the you know that was China virus territory and a lot of people were afraid to come out like security and a lot of people they were afraid nobody knew what was going on but we have good people I I I don't I can't imagine it would be possible they're going to try they have all their A team out that that's the only thing they do well actually they cheat and also misinformation they say we really want to run against Trump well how did that work out for Hillary not too good and remember last time we did much better than we did in 2016 we got like 12 million more votes right we got more votes than any sitting president in history and we lost to a guy that never lo you know never left his basement he didn't get 80 million votes he didn't get 80 million votes and they have a big enthusiasm problem now you know it's interesting speaking of that so I left the Hotel this morning here and they said sir Nikki H is going to have a very big protest outside so I figured I'm going to walk down I'll wave to everybody and you know the H project there was nobody there it was one guy who was the nicest guy he had a little tiny Haley that name was like this big wasn't wasn't like that guy or that guy or these people with those beautiful signs L but it wasn't like that tiny little thing you could barely read I was actually going to suggest that he make it larger but he was a nice guy he goes hi president Trump hi hi I said hi I I could have persuaded him but I was late for the other rally I wanted to be nice on time unlike what I was for you I wanted to be I wanted to be on time but this big rally turned out to be one person the nicest rally goer I've ever seen for the other side I'm sure he's going to vote for us I was nice to him I said hi make sure you I said make sure you go and vote and he said thank you very much but that's what they have they have no enthusiasm our people have enthusiasm so I heard it's going to be very so I saw Bobby Bobby Kaufman I saw the whole group backstage I said well I hear the weather's going to be very cold it's going to be cold not going to be rainy it's going to be cold and they said that's good why is it good why is that good because the other side will never vote because they don't have any enthusiasm we won't lose one vote because our people they use the term will walk on glass they're not going to stay away they're going to walk on glass so and I think it's true because I've never you know we've gone through two unbelievably successful campaigns and again the second was much more successful but you know bad things happened but we've gone through two and the first one was legendary but this will be more legendary this will be the biggest thing perhaps ever to happen in politics and we're fighting against these weaponized criminals you know where they weaponize and you know two can play that game it's very dangerous game once they start that but we could have done a lot of stuff too I thought it was so bad for the country I thought it was so bad for the country and it is very bad for the country but uh and they are criminals you look at the kind of things the stuff that the money he takes from these foreign countries if that were us they would have reinstituted the death penalty if that were us you know the money that he gets from China that he gets the $3.5 million from Russia remember I brought that up in the stage Chris swall said you can't talk about that I said why he got $3.5 million from the mayor of moscow's wife what did he do for it did he work for it did he invest no I don't think so he invested in his own pocket but I said why is that the money they've taken and you know two can play this game it's a very dangerous ious game and it's very bad for our country and our country is dying and there's no time to waste you vote you have to get these establishment politicians out of there because they're bad whether it's democrat or republican unlike every other candidate in this race with me you know in your heart that I will always put America first which I will I think I proven that I could have had a nice life look I didn't need this I got indicted more than alons Capone did you ever hear of Al Capone Al Capone he was the greatest mobster of them all Scarface you ever see the movie Scarface he had a scar from here to there Scar and I think he probably liked it he thought it' look good but Al Capone he was indicted less than me I got indicted because I challenged a crooked election now it's turned out you saw the facts that came out two days ago 100% right I have no doubt about it never did have any doubt about it but now what they're doing is misinformation that's right you're right about that actually well they do have a trump was right about everything I actually was including Wuhan I said Wuhan that's where it came from you know everyone was saying they tried to blame Italy they tried to blame France they tried to blame us they tried to blame the American soldiers you know the soldiers said what did we have to do with it but now it came out of the lab I said it came out of the lab from W and that's what happened that's a sad thing and I think it was incompetence you know a lot of people think otherwise I think it was gross incompetence I think the scientist walked out had lunch with his girlfriend she died shortly thereafter and a lot of people started dying and that's where it spread that's how it came I believe I've said it from the beginning but a vote for Donald Trump in these caucuses is a vote to secure your border a vote to stop the invasion of our country it's like a military Invasion cuz I believe that killing I believe they're killing 300,000 people a year not you know you always hear 90 90 I've been hearing 90 for 15 years I believe it's 300 350,000 and we had it down to the lowest number in a long time because we not only stopped you know we had the safest border ever recorded meaning perhaps 200 years ago it was good I doubt it but we had the safest border ever recorded and there's never been anything like that and now we have the worst we have the worst immigration situation of any country anywhere in the world ever there's never been even a third world country where you have a thing like this and they would stop it they'd use Sticks and Stones if they had to but they wouldn't let it happen we let it happen we encourage it and these are people that are occupying our Hospitals now they're taking the place of our vets I mean our vets are sleeping out on the street and these people are staying at the Waldorf Historia Hotel it's CRA it's crazy it's crazy it's really bad it's a vote to to rescue our economy and it's a vote to reclaim our democracy because you know that's his new theme did you watch him stumble through that speech last night Donald Trump is a threat to democracy now that's the only thing he can say because they didn't do anything in fact a lot of the people were saying you know got a little tired I think he mentioned my name 29 times but he said Donald Trump is a threat to democracy that's going to be their case because he can't say anything good the the world is blowing up they asked the great Victor Orban of Hungary one of the toughest smartest leaders in the world actually one a very respected very tough guy very tough guy he doesn't play games they say what could we do to make the world safer he says make sure Trump becomes president because when he was PR now he said this I wouldn't say it he said when he was president China feared him Russia feared him every country feared him I don't want to say let's say respect but they fear feared our country because they knew that there was no games Russia was never going into Ukraine and it was the apple of his eye I talked to him a lot Putin you know they hated when I got along with Putin but I like getting along with people with 1,600 nuclear weapons I think getting along with that I got along with Kim Jung you would have been if Hillary got in at the time if Hillary got in you would have been in a nuclear war with Kim Jong and he expected it I got to know him he liked me we got a long grade it was didn't start that way Little Rocket Man all the stuff it started it started tough but he got along we got along and he had no problem but now he's getting very anxious again he's getting very anxious because they're not dealing with him properly they're not dealing with anybody properly and that's why you could end up in a third world war and while we're close to the election we're not close enough because 10 months for them they can destroy our country all the way in 10 months 10 months they can destroy our country country and you probably heard me say if you took the 10 worst Presidents I used to say the five and then I realized the five don't even come close if you took the 10 worst Presidents in the history of our country the 10 worst you added them up they won't have do they couldn't have done the damage that this guy has done to our country and remember you know Maga is the greatest probably the greatest ever in politics but I was going to put it KAG I'm glad I didn't do that actually KAG keep American America great but then I realized America is not great I can't use it America is not great right now we're going to make it great we're going to make it better than ever before but right now we're a laughing stock all over the world so this election is our last chance to save America the battle begins in Iowa okay begins right here first in the nation it begins right here in Iowa on January 15th and Joe Biden's bana Republic ends on November 5th 201 24 that's what it is and with your help we're going to bring back our country we're going to bring it back from hell because this country has been in hell what they've done and they ought to you know what they ought to do they ought to release the j6 hostages they've suffered enough they had to release them I call them hostages some people call them prisoners I call them hostages release the j6 hostages Joe release him Joe you can do it real easy Joe this guy what he's done what he's done to people and antifa knocks the hell out of Portland takes over parts of Seattle destroys Minneapolis if I didn't send in the soldiers Minneapolis you wouldn't even have Minneapolis right because the governor wouldn't do anything I'm not even supposed to do that I had no choice seven days in i s them in the place was burning down they took over the police station the police weren't allowed to do their jobs we got to allow the police to do their job so we're going to indemnify the police against liability and you'll stop crying remember that CNN guy he's up uh this is really a friendly protest remember that Minneapolis this is a friendly protest and right behind him the whole city was burning to the ground do you remember that as far as the I could it was all flames and I mean all massive it looked the biggest fire I've ever seen and he said this is CNN that's right CNN this is a this has been a friendly protest friendly no it's one of the greatest scenes in the history of television as he's call and behind it I don't mean like there's a little smoke the whole place was on in Flames it was crazy now they're really bad but Victory cannot come soon enough as we speak the last remnants of our open open and broken borders are crumbling into Rubble as millions and millions of people storm into the United States and the largest illegal Mass migration in the history of the world there's never been a migration like this millions and millions of people it'll be 15 or 16 million people by the end of this guy's term and I'm not even sure he understands you know he's not a smart guy I never used to talk this way about him I talk very badly about him now because he did he indicted me four times that means everything's off right he has this guy Jack Smith he's a deranged human being he's a nut jab I have him and he's being investigated on boxes he did real stuff because he he wasn't protected by the presidential records act but I have Jack Smith derange Jack Smith I call him and he's all over the place trying to frighten people trying to scare people and he has a very bad record you know why because he always goes too far he goes so far and he's got a bad record Lost before The Supreme Court a couple of times but a record 300,000 illegal aliens were detected crossing the borders in December think of that 300,000 that's bigger than almost any City you have in your state Iowa has I don't know how many people in De Mo how many people does de Mo have what is it 100,000 got to be bigger than that he said 200 whatever 300,000 came in like in the last couple of months 300,000 we have no idea I say from Parts Unknown it's from Parts Unknown ladies and gentlemen we have 300,000 people from Parts Unknown they have languages that we don't even have people that know what the languages are so it's it's rough stuff what they're doing to our country but we're going to turn it around under the Trump Administration we had the most secure Border in US history we built 561 miles of border wall you know I tell people because they like to say we did 50 miles okay 50 miles when the the first week so if we have a 2x4 laying on the ground and over there that's 50 years old and rotted just sort of decayed and just list you know maybe it was a little bit of a tiny wall or something which we throw away and start the new wall we go down 8 ft we go up 30 feet and 40 ft but if there's a little piece of Steel that's 50 years old that's rotted laying on the ground they say he didn't build a wall there that was just a renovation these people are sick and you do you have garbage laying up and down the Border anytime you had anything it was a piece of paper L they say it was a renovation because they don't want you we did an unbelievable job the reason our numbers are so good are that and of course I got 28,000 soldiers free of charge from Mexico not easy to get when I went to the president I said you have to give us 28,000 soldiers while we're building the wall and remember when I used to say Mexico will pay for pieces of the wall but you can't do it legally it's a little hard for them to pay for a wall that we own you know it's not that easy but there was no real legal mechanism but there was a mechanism where they could pay for soldiers so I want 28,000 soldiers on the border uh I want to remain in Mexico policy I got all this stuff and I got it despite the state department everyone else telling you can't get it a woman at the state department was terrific but she was not a good negotiator she said sir you can't get free soldiers from Mexico we've been asking them for years they won't do it I said yes they will 100% they'll do it 100% And as far as Catch and Release you know Catch and Release meant we release him into our country we had a new a new definition Catch and Release we release him into Mexico slight difference slight difference and then we had remain in Mexico remember Tiana Tiana over about a two-e period became like the largest city in the world I'm only kidding when I say I have to be very careful because when I say something like that and I'm sarcastic they say he called Tiana the largest city and soul is larger and Beijing is larger you know if you if you're a little sarcastic with these characters they say he lied we giving him a Pinocchio you know Pinocchio four SARS because I said Tiana but Tiana became a massive mess because they had hundreds of thousands of people there that we wouldn't allow into the country Biden ended that it wasn't easy to get and I was very tough with Mexico I said you know you do this and by the way Mexico now is asking for $5 billion if we want them to help us keep people out of our country can you they would never have done that with me I said look if you don't do it because they had a representative come in I said if you don't do that and he was a handsome guy came in and I really do I like the president of mexo he's a great great guy he's a socialist but what the hell can you do you got to you can't have them all right but he's a great guy and he sent his top negotiator his top representative came in very handsome Suave guy beautifully dressed I remember how good I was going to ask him for his tailor but I didn't feel like going to Mexico to get a suit it wasn't worthwhile to go to Mexico to get a suit but very Suave guy and I say we need 28,000 soldiers and you're going to have to pay for them no no no he looks laughing no we won't do oh yes you will no you will do it 100% you're going to do it no no we're not going to do it yes you will you will do it just you'll do it and he didn't know what was going on then I said we want remain in Mexico everybody that's at the border is going to remain in Mexico and did we create a mess there because Tijana and these cities along the border were they had a lot of people and uh no no we won't do that we can't allow that we're not equipped for that I said yes you are you're going to do it and then we had other things including our title program where we had you know if sick people are sick we don't want them in our country we don't want them in our country so he said no no no I said yes yes yes you're going to do it don't worry about it he said we will not do it you're going to do it 100% you're going to do it I said here's the story in front of me I have a piece of paper that I actually signed on Monday morning this was Friday afternoon on Monday morning we're going to charge every piece of equipment every car that you took out of the United States you know they took out 32% of our business they make them in Mexico they have some of the largest Auto plants in the world they stole them from our stupid people our stupid I hate to say it because again I have a lot of respect for a president but our presidents were very stupid when they allowed this to happen 32% of our automobile business was taken out of our country and is in Mexico so they sent massive numbers millions of cars into our country I said we're going to charge you 25% on every car that comes into our country and 25% on every item and in two months it goes to 50% and in two months after that it goes to 75% and maybe I'll stop at 75% and he goes no no no no no no no and he said may I be excused may I make a phone call and he comes back I said but make it quick if you would have to get out of here and I tell you I really impressed the woman at the state toar she and she was a good woman but she said I can't believe this because all these things and I also I asked Tom homman I asked Brandon Jud the great guys by the way all they had to do is let them do their jobs this guy would go to the beach if he didn't tell him to do if he went to the beach that little chair that he holds up of course it's like three ounces right a child can they're meant for children to lift them for the grandfather right he can't lift them did you see how couldn't get it out of the sand the thing weighs like 6 ounces I guess and if he would have gone to the beach cuz somebody in his campaign said you look really good in a bathing so you know when you're 82 or whatever the hell he is I know a lot of people by the way in their 80s that the sharpest people I know a friend of mine became a billionaire from he always he never quite made it and then he hit big from 80 to 90 he became worth billions of dollars you can be this is not an age thing this is this is something else is going on up there with this guy but all he had to do is leave it alone he could have gone to the beach if he would have gone to the beach and left everything alone he would have had the safest Border in history but he decided to end everything that we were doing he wouldn't even put up the planks the panels of wall we had bought them 200 miles of wall he sold them I understand for 5 cents and the dollar it's expensive stuff because it's rebar it's what they wanted it's rebar concrete and still in the outside and it's really it's really a sad thing I will tell you it's really a sad thing we had the greatest border we had the greatest Border in history and now we have the worst Border in the history of the world no place in the world but Ronda sanctimonious Nikki Haley and the rest have never will they're never going to be into securing the Border because they're globalists they want the globe they like the globe and they believe it maybe they're right I don't think they're right I think I've proven they're not right and we want to protect America and we'll help people but we want to protect America we've got $35 trillion in debt you know that debt we were going to be drilling like crazy and we were already became number one we went from number four to number one in a period of of short period of time we were so drill baby drill you're right about that but we were we were doing so well it was Saudi Arabia and then Russia and we were down here and you have to see the chart I got to get the chart for the people at some point it goes like we're down here then all of a sudden we go Trump gets in he goes and we passed Russia we passed Saudi Arabia we were doing more and soon we were going to be energy dominant we were energy independent but we're going to be selling to Europe to Asia all over the world we were going to be selling we would have been paying off our debt it was unbelievable then this guy comes in and stopped everything he gave up anoir in Alaska I got anoir so proud of it I got anoir nobody could do it Ronald Reagan couldn't do it he tried so hard he couldn't get it approved and that was a lot easier environmentally a lot lot easier in those days but I got it approved we were going to start drilling in nare very shortly great for Alaska but great for the country for the world the largest site probably bigger than Saudi Arabia think of that and he ended it in his first week he terminated everything I did we worked our asses off to get that he terminated everything that I did on anir that would have made so much money for this country but we're going to pay you off debt we had a machine going and then we had a rigged election and all of that ended then we had inflation which was caused by the way by energy you know when your gasoline triples and quadruples and you're Heating and your house goes up everything else is going to go up too the bakery is going to go up they deliver their donuts and they use their fuel to cook the whatever it is everything goes up energy is so big and uh we had it at a level that nobody we had the greatest economy in the history of the world we had the greatest economy and they blew it and we had no inflation one of the biggest donors to Nikki Haley's campaign is this slob known as Reed Hoffman a big slob I can't use the word fat so I won't they'll criticize me if I say fat you're not allowed to use fat so I will not call him a fat slob I'll just call him a slob you're allowed to but a real slob you got to look at the picture of this guy but he's a rich guy he supports he supports crooked think of it he supports all of these crooked people but he also supports Haley can you believe it you know why because they don't want to run against Trump but they're great on misinformation disinformation it's almost the same but it's actually not but we won't go into definitions they are great on misinformation disinformation we want to run against Trump that's what Hillary said too let's run against Trump that'll be wonderful but we want to run against Trump we beat him the first time we beat him this they don't want to run against me but we say they say that because that's sort of demeaning every poll has us beating Biden they're losing to Biden they all say oh well we want to you know we're going to win they're not going to win first of all they can't beat me they're 50 60 points down they're not going to win and they're going to get hit harder than me so with me they hit me and they won't take it like I take it because I take it people do say you know they say two questions they have for me one is Sir how do you do it how do you take it and the other one is will they do it again they better not do it again we have a lot of good people and we're we're fighting like hell I actually say don't worry about the vote we're going to get plenty of votes just worry about securing the vote and we used to say election day right but today you have election period you have some of these things that going for 55 days we want one day voting we want paper ballots and we want voter ID and Republican governor should do it right now there's no reason for them to wait but much like with Ronda santimon is the people who fund Nikki Haley aren't working for your interest they're working for their interest they really are and uh look I know them both very well I mean they're both uh they're very disloyal Nikki would say I will never run against the he did this for years I will never run against the president he was a great president I will never run I always used to say that's nice but I knew her so I figured you know when's it going to come because she can't help herself I knew it and then one day she called it and answer I've decided to run for president not going to do the job job for you she's not going to do the job so you have that and you have Biden and all they're going to do is Grant amnesty to Biden's illegal aliens and they'll do it very early because they believed in that and they also believed in hurting your Social Security they believed in hurting your Medicare and I didn't you know Ronda sanct demonius wanted to lift the age from a much different number much different up to above 70 and he voted on it three times you don't want that that we have so much wealth under our feet in the liquid gold we don't need to hurt people with Social Security senior citizens and they'll go back when Ron and the same thing with Nikki both of them I wouldn't tell you who to vote for I tell you I wouldn't know they're both not good they're both you know there's a rumor that Ron's going to leave the race right after this I read it big no he's going to and he's going to endorse me I don't know if that's true or not I make it much harder for him to but that's okay it doesn't matter but the rumors big story just came out did anybody see it that Ron's going to leave so you're really into politics you and going to leave the race he's going to endorse me and that's going to be it well that' be nice but you know what it's important we got to get the biggest vote because I'm thinking more about November we have to send a signal to these crooked people out there to a corrupt Washington by the way we're going to also federalize Washington we're going to take over our Capital which is so dirty so horrible and so unsafe three people killed over the last couple of days shot tourists the parks are disgusting the most beautiful parks in the world the buildings have graffiti the white marble columns the Beautiful the statuary marble the most beautiful marble you've ever seen gorgeous columns that are 10 ft thick and they've got graffiti all over they have swast stickers on them we don't do anything it's filthy dirty we're going to redo it we're going to get rid of the slums we're going to redo it we're going to bring it back it's going to be the most beautiful capital in the world and most importantly we're going to make it safe we're going to give the police back their Authority we're going to make it safe so people can actually walk down the street without getting shot and we're going to do that the same things for our cities because our cities are in tremendous Decay right now our cities are all run by democrats the cities we're talking about but we're going to go into our major cities New York Chicago Los Angeles and we're going to rebuild our cities and we're going to make them safe we're going to give the police back their Authority we're going to indemnify the police so that when they get sued all the time they get sued and the city doesn't back them up but we're going to indemnify our police so if they stop criminals from robbing sores how about this new phenomena where 3 400 people mostly young people go into a department store and they just loot the hell out of it there's nothing left in the store and then they have to close they spent millions of dollars building it millions of dollars stocking it and these guys go in and a half hour they walk out with televisions uh those people are going to be dealt with so tough and as soon as we and you know what I mean by tough and as soon as that happens in one day the whole thing will stop but we have to bring back our police we have to help our police we have to love our police I met a lot of your great policemen backstage and and they know how to do it but we're going to indemnify them because they do get sued they get SU Su and you're going to always have some bad apples you're always going to have that I'm sorry no matter what but you know we can't let that because we've gone the other way police it's like they have no power they can't even talk to people don't don't shout don't shout if they're robbing how about this if they're robbing a store let them rob it this is the orders to the police let them Rob the store no no if they're robbing the store they're going to be so tough they'll I don't know if we'll do the Clint Eastwood thing right make my day he wants to do that remember CL Eastwood make my day go ahead he had the gun to make make my day go ahead the guy's inching toward the gun I don't know that we'll do that but could be close I mean you know could but not one thing has gotten better under crooked Joe Biden under the Trump administr think of it not one thing what name me one thing that's gotten [Applause] better well inflation's gotten bigger that's about the only thing you can say right what a disaster you know we're up almost 30% over 3 years and you know you're not going to bring that down they think it's down because the economy is getting bad you know they've made interest rates so high that the economy is getting killed right now so but you're not going to solve the problem where your bacon costs four times more than it cost three years ago numbers that are incredible four or five times more for food and for other items under the Trump Administration you were better off your family was better off your neighbors were better off your communities were better off off and your country was better off other than that you should be quite unhappy America was Stronger richer safer and more confident than ever and when I was in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute desk you ever hear the Resolute desk most beautiful desk I love that desk we got to get back to that desk this country was in great shape we had the greatest economy think of it greatest economy ever we had the lowest number of regulations in 50 5 years no president cut regulations that's why we had such great job numbers we were bringing people back China was paying us hundreds of billions of dollars we were giving a lot of it to the farmers in Iowa and Nebraska and other great places and I joke but that's why you know backstage they say to me some sometimes sir don't tell them that they're going to vote for you that sounds so demeaning I said I got them $28 billion for their farmers of course they got to vote we're going to win Iowa so big I got them $28 billion of course I'm going to win you know maybe who knows but I tell them you think Joe Biden would get 28 you think he lies awake at night tossing and turning and how are we going to take care of President she president she is very smart and he all business you meet him we will now get down to business I said this is a little different this isn't GE it's a nice day how's the sky this this is serious stuff these guys are serious and there's nobody smart they're smart they're cunning they love their country different forms of love thank you I agree with that actually but different forms of love but they're tough and they're smart uh you look at France Emmanuel macron he was going to put taxes on I said you going to put those taxes on I'm going to put a tax on your champagne and your wine coming in we're going to put big big taxes on so I will tell you this we are going to bring this country back to a level that you haven't seen before we're going to bring the country back like it hasn't and by the way here's some of my staff they can't get enough of me so they come out to watch the great suszie WS the legendary Susie wild she ran Florida for me you know nobody wants to say it but I got 1.4 million more votes than Ronda sanctimonious you know nobody want he only got good votes because I endorsed him but we got 1.4 or 1.5 million more votes than Ronda sanct tonius but she ran it for me now she's running the whole campaign I shouldn't say this I'll make her famous then somebody's going to hire away but I don't think that's going to happen cuz she's into it do you know that gentleman right there very famous man Walt Walt he's in many ways more famous than I am and he's a good man too but it's no wonder the same corrupt forces that have been fighting us every step of the way they fight us and fight us and fight us they don't want us going back because we found out things that are just uh too bad so look we are going to get elected you're going to get out there in caucus I'm going to be with you for caucus I'm coming back in two days three days we're going to make this was a rather hectic day we made lots of lots of stops and lots of speeches and big ones the level I will tell you this the level of enthusiasm I've never seen anything like it but we're going to come back and remember if you want to save America from crooked Joe then get every Patriot you know get 10 you know we say 10 for 10 but get 10 and make sure they're registered Republicans you have to register as Republicans get them out to vote and it's Monday January 15th 7.m I'm going to be there we're all going to be there together and we're going to be first you're first in the nation because of me but we're going to be America first again it's America First there's nobody that we put ahead of our country there's nobody that we're going to put ahead of our country the whole world is watching so learn how to caucus I'm going to learn with you cuz I have no idea how to caucus but we're all smart we're going to learn very quickly I leave you with this look we have a special thing happening we have numbers like nobody's ever seen before forget that get out and vote we're going to set a tune and we're going to set an authority like nobody's ever seen before and we love you I recognize so many of you we've we've won twice we've won twice and you know we've won twice and and you take a look and from Fort Dodge to Cedar Rapids from De Mo to Daffin Port from waterl to Sous City to right here in Clinton oh I'm so glad I didn't cancel you out that would have been the end that would have been the end we stand on the shoulders of generations of Iowa Patriots who tamed the Wilderness Brave the elements till the soil work the fields all true isn't it built the factories and poured out their Blood Sweat and Tears to make this country into the greatest nation in the history of the world but now we are a nation in Decline we are we are a nation in Decline sad to say we are a failing Nation we are a nation that has lost its confidence its willpower and strength think of the words lost its confidence we do we have no confidence as a nation we're being left at all over the world but we are not going to allow this horror to continue three years ago we were a great nation and we will soon be a great nation again we're going to be a great nation [Applause] again and remember that it was hardworking Patriots like you who built this country and it is hardworking Patriots like you who are going to save our country we will fight for America like no one has ever fought before 2024 is our final battle it's our final battle remember this we together are going to do something that will be I believe the biggest event in the history of our country that's how important it is and they're going to put up stop signs all along the way and many of them are illegal stop signs they're bad they're bad people they're very bad they're sick people with you at my side we will demolish the Deep State we will expel the warmongers from our government we will drive out the globalists we will cast out the Communist Marxist and fascists we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country they hate our country with a passion it can be the only reason they do what they do we will route the fake news media those people right there and we will evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House on Election night 2024 the great silent majority is rising like never before like never before the level of spirit and pride and enthusiasm is greater than it was in 16 and it's greater than it was at 20 and I shouldn't say this but any numbers that they're thinking about I think we going to even be bigger than that next week it's going to be bigger than any numbers because that's what's there it's it's the underbelly it's bigger than anybody has any idea of what's going on because it's based on common sense it's based on safety it's based on Pride we want to see our country be great again we want it to be not just great we want to have the greatest country in the world without question and we had that we had something that has never been duplicated what we did never been duplicated under our leadership the Forgotten man and woman will be forgotten no longer you're not going to be forgotten we didn't forget you for four years but Biden totally forgot you we will love our country we will take care of our country we will pray to God for our strength and for our Liberty we will pray for God and we will be with God because we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under God and together we will make America powerful again we will make America wealthy again we will make America strong again we will make America proud again we will make it proud We will make America safe for get going to be safe and we will make America great again thank you Iowa thank you God bless you all thank [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] my I'm I'm [Music] I'm [Music] I you [Music] [Applause] oh \n"
